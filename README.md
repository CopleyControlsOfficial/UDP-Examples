# UDP-Examples
The repository contains examples for communicating with Copley Controls servo drives using UDP protocol.
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the core communication protocols of the Internet protocol suite used to send messages to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. Send ASCII or serial-binary data using raw ethernet sockets to the server in the drive to communicate with the drive via UDP. Please refer to the applications note, AN121 UDP Command Mode for more details.
